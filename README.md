### Introduction
-----------
 `Rubik's Cube` is a PC game made on Unity 3D. <br>
 The objective of this project was to make a Rubik's Cube by using quaternions, vectors, and planes without using some Unity functions such as Rotate and Rotate Around <br>
 This project has been made by **RABINNE Lenny** and **ERBISTI Mat√©o**. <br>
 This project really helped us to understand how quaternions can be useful in games and how to use them.
